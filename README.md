In this project, Ive created a system that takes login creditials and assigns a task to a user, you can edit it and change the due dates.
This task manager is a good use if you a Teacher to keep all your students in order and never lose track in homework and what has to be done.
It takes username and password to append your details to a user.txt file and all the assigned tasks goes to tasks.txt file.
It can generate reports on the students work and assignments to see what is completed and what is not completed. You can display percentages of the tasks and see whats not commpleted, the overdue percentages.
